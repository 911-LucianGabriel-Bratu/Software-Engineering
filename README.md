-User should be abletomanage items, including removal.
-Desktop app or webapp;-Propose friendly display of items and waystomanage them;-Users can cancel their account (GDPR) or modify it.

What do you have to implement?

1.Implement a login mechanism in the application for both types of users (normal userand administrator).
It will be considered that they are already present in the application and have created accounts, so there is no need to signup.

2.After logging in, the administratorwill be able to see the list of public destinations

3.The adminwill have to be able to add a new item to the list of public destinations.

4.A normal userwill be able to see both the list of public destinations and hisownprivate list (here called bucket list)–after logging in.

5.A normal userwill be able to add an item to his private list(bucket list)

6.The normal userwill be able toeither create a new item from scratch, or use one already existing in the public list for which he will need to add stay dates.
The application can be both web ordesktop; any programming language can be usedThe application must broadly respect a softwarearchitecture, which each team will have to explain at the end of the semester. 

It is recommended to havea graphic interface as user friendly as possible.
